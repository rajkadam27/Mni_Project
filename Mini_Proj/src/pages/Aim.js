        Theme customization in React allows users to adjust the appearance of a web application dynamically, enabling a better user experience. Theming allows for features like switching between light and dark modes, adjusting color schemes, typography, and other design elements, without having to reload or change the underlying components. By implementing theme customization, you provide users the ability to modify the look and feel of the application to suit their preferences.
